# Hotdog
This is the first group project of the DTU course [Introduction to Deep Learning in Computer Vision](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2025-2026/02516?menulanguage=en). 

Classification of image as hotdog or not hotdog. The images are stored locally in the `hotdog_nothotdog` folder.

The dataloader takes care of finding the train and testset within the main folder. The images are automatically resized. We were able to setup a training loop for a basic model. 

The next steps would be for everyone to start experimenting with different approaches, architectures, optimizers, etc. And next week we align on our current results. We can include all of our approaches in the final report, and choose the best performing one, or merge the best ideas.

we can all work on different branches. The .ipynb file we created can be a starting template for everyone.
